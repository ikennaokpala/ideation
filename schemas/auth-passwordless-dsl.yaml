# AUTH-PASSWORDLESS-DSL.YAML - DEPRECATED REDIRECT
#
# This file is DEPRECATED. The canonical auth specification is now in auth.yaml.
#
# MIGRATION NOTICE:
# - auth.yaml: Core authentication specification (OTP, OAuth, tokens, database)
# - auth-passwordless-addendum.yaml: White-label and multi-tenant extensions
#
# This file exists only for backwards compatibility with imports that reference
# this path. New specifications should import from auth.yaml directly.

# Redirect to canonical file
_redirect:
  canonical_file: "auth.yaml"
  reason: "Schema consolidation in SPARC v6.1.1"
  migration_date: "2025-01-01"

# Re-export from canonical file for backwards compatibility
# Tools should follow the _redirect directive and load auth.yaml instead
